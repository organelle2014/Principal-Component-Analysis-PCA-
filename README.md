Principal Component Analysis (PCA)


Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that transforms a high-dimensional dataset into a lower-dimensional one while preserving the most important information. It does this by identifying the directions of maximum variance in the data.   

Key Concepts:

a). Dimensionality Reduction: PCA reduces the number of variables in a dataset while retaining as much information as possible.   
b). Variance: PCA focuses on capturing the directions with the highest variance, as these directions often contain the most important information.   
c). Principal Components: The new variables created by PCA are called principal components. They are linear combinations of the original variables.   
d). Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues: PCA uses eigenvectors and eigenvalues to find the principal components. Eigenvectors represent the directions of maximum variance, while eigenvalues represent the amount of variance explained by each eigenvector.

How PCA Works:
1. Standardize the Data: The data is standardized to have zero mean and unit variance. This ensures that all variables are on the same scale.
2. Compute the Covariance Matrix: The covariance matrix is calculated to measure the relationships between the variables.   
3. Compute Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues: The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are calculated. The eigenvectors represent the principal components, and the eigenvalues represent the amount of variance explained by each principal component.   
4. Sort Eigenvectors: The eigenvectors are sorted in descending order of their corresponding eigenvalues.   
5. Select Principal Components: The top k eigenvectors are selected, where k is the desired number of dimensions for the reduced dataset.   
6. Transform the Data: The original data is projected onto the selected principal components to create the reduced dataset
